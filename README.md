# CSES questions in OCaml

This is a tiny and very rough script for running and verifying your OCaml answers for CSES questions.

To run:
```
python3 test.py
```

Make sure you have saved your username and password in `config.ini`.

Enter the code of the question when prompted (e.g. for https://cses.fi/problemset/submit/1068/, enter 1068).

Enter the source file and the script will compile and run it against the CSES test cases locally.
